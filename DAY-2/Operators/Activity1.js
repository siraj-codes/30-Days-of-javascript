// Activity 1: Arithmetic Operations


// Task 1: Write a program to add two numbers and log the result to the console. Task 2: Write a program to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console.

let n1 = 12;
let n2 = 45;

let additon = n1+n2;

console.log(`Additon is ${n1} + ${n2}  = ${additon}\n`)

// Task 3: Write a program to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console.
let multiply = n1*n2;
console.log(`Multiplication is ${n1} * ${n2}  = ${multiply}\n`)
// Task 4: Write a program to divide two numbers and log the result to the console.
let Div = n1/n2;
console.log(`Divison is ${n1} / ${n2}  = ${Div}\n`)
// Task 5: Write a program to find the remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result to the console.
let Rem = n1%n2;
console.log(`Reminder is ${n1} % ${n2}  = ${Rem}\n`)
